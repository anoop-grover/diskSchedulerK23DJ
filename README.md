üñ•Ô∏è **Problem Statement - Adaptive Disk Scheduling Visualizer**  

üìä **Description** - Develop an interactive tool that simulates various disk scheduling algorithms with real-time visualizations. Users should be able to input request sequences, track head movement on a graphical disk, and analyze performance metrics like seek time, latency, and throughput.



üñ•Ô∏è **Adaptive Disk Scheduling Visualizer**
A visual, interactive disk scheduling algorithm simulator built with Python and Tkinter.

üìã **Overview**
This application demonstrates various disk scheduling algorithms with an intuitive graphical interface. It provides real-time visualization of disk head movements and detailed performance metrics to help understand the efficiency of different scheduling strategies.

‚ú® **Features**
‚Ä¢	Multiple Disk Scheduling Algorithms:
       o	First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
       o	Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
       o	SCAN
       o	C-SCAN
       o	LOOK
       o	C-LOOK
‚Ä¢	Interactive Request Management:
       o	Add disk requests with customizable parameters (Request Sequence, Initial Head Position)
       o	Delete or reset request entries
       o	Dynamic request queue visualization
‚Ä¢	Visual Representation:
       o	Graphical disk head movement visualization
       o	Real-time animation of seek operations
       o	Color-coded track movements for clarity
‚Ä¢	Comprehensive Performance Metrics:
       o	Total seek time
       o	Average seek time
       o	Seek sequence visualization
       o	Throughput analysis
       o	Efficiency comparison between algorithms
