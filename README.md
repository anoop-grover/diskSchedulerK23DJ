## **üñ•Ô∏è Adaptive Disk Scheduling Visualizer**

A visual, interactive disk scheduling algorithm simulator built with Python and Tkinter.

## üìã **Overview**

This application demonstrates various disk scheduling algorithms with an intuitive graphical interface. It provides real-time visualization of disk head movements and detailed performance metrics to help understand the efficiency of different scheduling strategies.
## ‚ú® **Features**

‚Ä¢	**Multiple Disk Scheduling Algorithms:**

o	First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)  
o	Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)  
o	SCAN  
o	C-SCAN  
o	LOOK  
o	C-LOOK  

‚Ä¢	**Interactive Request Management:**

o	Add disk requests with customizable parameters (Request Sequence, Initial Head Position)  
o	Delete or reset request entries  
o	Dynamic request queue visualization  

‚Ä¢	**Visual Representation:**

o	Graphical disk head movement visualization  
o	Real-time animation of seek operations  
o	Color-coded track movements for clarity  

‚Ä¢	**Comprehensive Performance Metrics:**

o	Total seek time  
o	Average seek time  
o	Seek sequence visualization  
o	Throughput analysis  
o	Efficiency comparison between algorithms


## **üöÄ Installation & Setup**

**Prerequisites:**

‚Ä¢	Python 3.6+  
‚Ä¢	tkinter  
‚Ä¢	matplotlib

**Installation:**
1.Clone the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/adaptiveDiskScheduler.git
    cd adaptiveDiskScheduler

2.Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
3.Run the application:

    python diskscheduler.py

## **üßôÔ∏è Usage**

1.	**Adding Requests:**

o	Enter the sequence of disk requests.  
o	Specify the initial head position.  
o	Click "Add Request" to include it in the queue.  

2.	**Selecting a Scheduling Algorithm:**

o	Choose from the dropdown menu (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK).  
o	Click "Run Scheduler" to execute the selected algorithm.  
o	View the head movement visualization and performance metrics below.

3.	**Managing Requests:**
o	Select a request and click "Delete" to remove it.  
o	Click "Reset" to clear all requests.

## **üß¨ Algorithms Explained**

‚Ä¢	**FCFS**: Requests are processed in the order they arrive.  
‚Ä¢	**SSTF**: Processes the request closest to the current head position.  
‚Ä¢	**SCAN**: Moves the disk head in one direction, serving requests, then reverses.  
‚Ä¢	**C-SCAN**: Like SCAN, but only serves requests in one pass before resetting.  
‚Ä¢	**LOOK**: Similar to SCAN but stops at the last request instead of going to the max/min track.  
‚Ä¢	**C-LOOK**: Like C-SCAN but stops at the last request before resetting.


## **üìä Performance Metrics**

‚Ä¢	**Total Seek Time**: Sum of all seek operations performed.  
‚Ä¢	**Average Seek Time**: Average movement required per request.  
‚Ä¢	**Throughput**: Number of requests completed per unit time.  
‚Ä¢	**Efficiency**: Comparison of different scheduling strategies.


## **üìú Note**

Currently, all code is contained in a single file. A proper code file structure will be implemented in upcoming updates.
## **üìú Future Enhancements**

‚Ä¢	Additional scheduling algorithms(F-SCAN, N-Step SCAN).  
‚Ä¢	Export functionality for metrics and charts.  
‚Ä¢	Enhanced animation of disk movements.  
‚Ä¢	Real-world workload simulation.
